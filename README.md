# Task Tracker app

You can test it here: [Showcase] (https://task-tracker-eight-xi.vercel.app/)
First project using React + FastAPI:

- Using Vite's React application + Shadcn UI library
- Responsive UI
- FastAPI + SQlite3 as the backend
- full CRUD operation support

It still needs to fix minor bugs. but the core feature are working flawlessly.

## Features / bugs to fix:

- ~~Error handling unknown errors~~ Done!
- fancy animations using Framer
- ~~loading screen to wait for Render's backend to run.~~ Done!
- Needs a favicon
