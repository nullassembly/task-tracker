# Task Tracker app

First project using React + FastAPI:

- Using Vite's React application + Shadcn UI library
- Responsive UI
- FastAPI + SQlite3 as the backend
- full CRUD operation support

It still needs to fix minor bugs. but the core feature are working flawlessly.

## Features / bugs to fix:

- Error handling unknown errors
- fancy animations using Framer
- loading screen to wait for Render's backend to run.
